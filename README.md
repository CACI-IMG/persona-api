# Persona API
The Persona API is a fake RESTful API that delivers made up data on a few endpoints

We would like you to write a REST API that uses the data provided and has the following endpoints:

- GET /search/{username} Searches the data for the specific username
- GET /people Returns all people with pagination
- DELETE /people/{username} Delete a person

## Must Haves

- Develop the server and endpoints mentioned above with a framework of your preference
- Think carefully about data storage and scalability. Determine any limitations of your server
- Write a few unit tests with good code coverage

We would like to see good practices regarding the REST API, project structure, code documentation and code organisation. Your server will need to be able to ingest new data and we are expecting to see good use of design patterns where needed and good security practices. 


## Nice To Haves

- Nice to have would be to containerise your server so that it can deployed easily.
- A front-end that will allow users to search for a person and return back their information. 


## Go The Extra Mile

Come up with some ideas to visualise the fake profile data on a Vuejs front-end
